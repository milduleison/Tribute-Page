                    <p>Correcting the works, P. Kalpok was more reliant on the methodology of the old masters: he drew attention to the repositioning of a good drawing on a given plane, a deep anatomical study. Painting focused on tonal shaping of the form, with less emphasis on color emotionality. I thought that a solid form was the foundation of art;taught to observe and analyze nature. P. Kalpok's work consists of landscapes and portraits. The painter has painted a number of portraiture and thematic compositions, frescos, painted a number of State theater performances, and has written "The Textbook of Painting Techniques". P. Kalpok's landscapes are lyrical. Some of them are realistic, others have impressionism features. Portraits - psychological, precise drawing. Frescoes - decorative, dynamic compositions.
